This project was designed to consume Cloud Events and allow you to track the Four Keys from the DORA report all based on Kubernetes making it portable accross cloud providers. Components CloudEvents Endpoint : endpoint to send all CloudEvents, these CloudEvents will be stored in the SQL database to the cloudevents-raw table. (Optional) CDEvents Endpoint : endpoint to send CDEvents, these CloudEvents will be stored in the SQL database to the cdevents-raw table, as they do not need any transformation. This endpoint validates that the CloudEvent received is a CD CloudEvent. CDEvents tranformers : These functions will read from the cloudevents-raw table and tranform the CloudEvents to CDEvents only when apply based on the function's mapping. The results needs to be stored into the cdevents-raw table for further processing. Metrics functions : These functions are in charge of calculating different metrics and store them into special tables, probably one per table. To calculate metrics these functions read from cdevents-raw . (Optional) Metrics Endpoint : allows you to query the metrics by name and add some filters. This is an optional component, as you can build a dashboard from the metrics tables without using the endpoints. Installation This project was created to consume any CloudEvent available and store it into a SQL database for further processing. Once the CloudEvents are into the system a function based approach can be used to translate to CDEvents which will be used to calculate the \"four keys\". We will install the following components in an existing Kubernetes Cluster (you can use KinD): Install Knative Serving Install Knative Eventing Install PostgreSQL: We use Helm to install postgresql on Kubernetes cluster.

The flow should look like: API Server Source -> CloudEvent Endpoint (cloudevents_raw) -> CDEvent Transformation (cdevents_raw) -> Deployment Frequency Function (writes to deployments table) Deployment Frequency Function : looks at the cdevents_raw table and counts Deployment CDEvents from different services. Calculate buckets: Daily , Weekly , Monthly , Yearly . This counts the number of deployments per day: SELECT distinct deploy_name AS NAME , DATE_TRUNC ( 'day' , time_created ) AS day , COUNT ( distinct deploy_id ) AS deployments FROM deployments GROUP BY deploy_name , day ; Deploy the four-keys components using ko for development: cd four-keys/ ko apply -f config/ Create a new Deployment in the default namespace to test that your configuration is working.
